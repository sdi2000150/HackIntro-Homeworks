# Homework #3

## Playing an Attack-Defense CTF Competition (160 Points)

### Topics: Everything Covered in the Class

Important Note: fair play above all - we do not attack the infrastructure, our fellow students or teachers. If something goes horribly wrong, we let the instructors know. The infrastructure is experimental with no guaranteed SLA - if something is not going as expected please show patience. The intent is to make this a combination [blue team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_team_(computer_security))/[red team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_team) exercise, modeled after a simplified verison of [Defcon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEF_CON).

## Dates

### Registration Deadline

Sign up with a team for the competition by Tuesday, May 27th 23:59.

### When is the Competition Active

The competitive part will last for 48 hours and will run from Friday, May 30th 18:00 up until Sunday, June 1st 18:00.

### When is the Write Up Due

After the competition ends, you and your team will have to do a write up on the event to complete the homework (see below).

## System Mechanics

Each team will be given unprivileged access to a Linux box with a set of services that you have to defend and network access to other boxes (with the same set of services) that you have to demonstrate attacks against. Your services need to be fully operational during the entire event - outages cost.

Unlike Jeopardy-style CTFs, you will have to demonstrate you can exploit services across time, with flags alternating multiple times during the event.

Further instructions on access and how you score points will be provided before the competition starts.

## Teams

You can form teams up to 6 people. We only have resources for a limited number of teams, so if your team is too small, we may force you to merge with another team. Choose your teammates wisely :)

## Requirements

To successfully complete this homework assignment, you will need to:

1. Register for the competition with a team.
2. Participate in the competition along with your team.
3. Create and commit a file `writeup.md` in this repository describing how the event went for you and team. The write up should include at a minimum:
   1. Which services you managed to exploit and how you accomplished that. If you exploited zero services, provide a write up of the ones you looked at.
   2. Which services you managed to patch and how you accomplished that. If you patched zero services, provide a write up of the analysis you did.
   3. What attacks were you able to recognize that other teams threw against you.
   4. What strategies did you use during the event? Cover every aspect of it, including: (1) attack, (2) defense, (3) delegation of duties within the team and so on.
   5. Lessons learned - what would you do differently if you did this again?

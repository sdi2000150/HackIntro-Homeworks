# Homework #1

## Playing a Capture-The-Flag (CTF) Competition (160 Points)

### Topics: Unix and Binary Exploitation

Important Note: fair play above all - we do not attack the infrastructure, our fellow students or teachers. If something goes horribly wrong, we let the instructor know. The infrastructure is experimental with no guaranteed SLA - if something is not going as expected please show patience.

## Requirements

To successfully complete this homework assignment, you will need to:

1. Sign up on [https://hackintro25.di.uoa.gr/](https://hackintro25.di.uoa.gr/) with a password you'll remember but do not care about if someone else finds it out. Keep in mind: this is experimental infrastructure and passwords may leak. Your username can be whatever you like but please sign up with your sdi email so that we can assign grades to your accomplishments. If you do not have an sdi, please email me and I can help you setup an account.
2. Solve as many challenges as you can from the "Binary Exploitation 1 - 25" competition. A minimum of **1200 points** is required to complete the homework.
3. Create and commit a file `username` in this repository containing the username you used in this competition. This will be necessary to complete identification.
4. Create and commit a file `writeup.md` in this repository describing your solution to the hardest (in your opinion) challenge that you managed to solve. Similar to the first homework, we will appreciate a well-written writeup (complete with solve scripts etc) since that is part of your grade.
5. Create and commit a file `collaborators` in which you can add the sdis of people that you discussed problems with (one sdi number per line). The homework should be completed individually, but we encourage discussion and exchanging ideas. In simple terms, we follow he "whiteboard policy": two people can chat and draw ideas on a board, but after the discussion is done, the board is erased (no photos :P) and both people have to reproduce the ideas and complete the challenge individually. The instructor has a good grasp of security policies and which ones are enforceable - we rely on you and your code of honor for fair play.

## Bonus Points
The sum total of all challenges released will greatly exceed 1200 points. Challenges completed beyond 1200 points will be considered bonus points. As an additional bonus: the first person to complete all challenges (if that happens!), will not have to create a write up (but a writeup will still be appreciated).

## Competition Rollout

New challenges will be continuously released as time progresses (either as stepping stones to existing ones, or entirely different), be on the look out for new ones!
